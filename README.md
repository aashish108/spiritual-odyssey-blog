# Responsive Jekyll Theme

I decided to utilise the Jekyll Web Framework to create my blog. Its just based on my readings from vedic spiritual literatures. I wanted to play around with a few technologies also:
* Jekyll
* Ruby
* GitHub Actions for CI/CD
* Self-hosted runner

So, its all fully automated using a great web framework.

its based on BEF Theme by [Artem Shekudko](https://artemsheludko.github.io/bef/)
